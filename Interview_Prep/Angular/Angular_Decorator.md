- The whole purpose of Angular decorators is to store metadata about a class, method, or property.
- There are four types of decorators in Angular:
	- Class Decorators
		- Class Decorators are the top-level decorators that are used to define the purpose for the classes.
		- Eg:
			- NgModule
				- ![[Pasted image 20220822210922.png]]
				- bootstrap  : Which component will start when this module starts
				- Providers : For services, which mostly are singlton, so to inject their Objects here
				- imports : Module that your module will use, could be user defined or the library
				- declarations: Components present in your module
			- Component

	- Property Decorators

			- ViewChild

	- Method Decorators
		- Eg:
			- HostListner
