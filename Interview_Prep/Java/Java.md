- Java 8 Features
	- Java 8 tries to embrace the Functional Programming aspect, functional Programming embraces:
		- Creating immutable Objects
		- More concise and readable code
		- and Treating functions as a first class citizens (You can pass function as parameters just like javascript)
	- Declarative vs Imperative:
		- Imperative - 'How' style of programming:
			- Example #1: ![[Pasted image 20220819111441.png]]
		- Declarative - 'What' style of programming:
			- ![[Pasted image 20220819111535.png]]
			- Just like how we don't care about the way SQL fetches the data from table, we are only concerned with the result....
		- Difference:
			- ![[Pasted image 20220819141105.png]]
			- Basically he used the library functions aready available for the result.
			- So here the sum variable is mutating every iterations, in multithreaded environment this could be dangerous

- Sorting algo:
	- Bubble : 
		- bar bar ek ek, we get the largest element in first iteration
	- Insertion Sort: 
		- Like Cards, left most is always sorted
		- Nothing is properly sorted yet, left is sorted and right is not.
	- Merge Sort: 
		- Divide conquer, first bring them to atomic and then while merging sort them
	- Quick Sort: 
		- Take a pivot, 
		- the pivot element after the first iteration will be at it's correct position
	- Selection Sort
		- select minimum and sort, so we get the smallest element in the first iteration
	- Tim Sort (The insertion merge sort (My definition))
