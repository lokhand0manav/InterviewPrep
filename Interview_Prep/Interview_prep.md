			- What I learned along the way:
				- WebSockets : Full Duplex bidirectional connection
				- UDP is not a reliable procotol and is also a Transport layer protocol just like TCP.
				- Even though HTTP is stateless protocol at Application layer, it uses TCP protocol at Transport layer which is actually a Stateful protocol. do not confuse this with UDP, even though like HTTP UDP also is stateless
				- Client side session and Server side session
